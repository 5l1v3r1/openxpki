# OpenXPKI@Docker

We have moved the Dockerfiles to a separate project:
https://github.com/openxpki/openxpki-docker

The repository contains a Dockerfile to build your own containers
as well as a docker-compose.yaml with a sample setup.

Prebuild docker images, based on the current debian packages, are 
available directly via `docker pull whiterabbitsecurity/openxpki`
