<h2>About OpenXPKI</h2>
<p>The OpenXPKI Project aims at creating an enterprise-scale 
PKI/Trustcenter software supporting well established infrastructure 
components like RDBMS and Hardware Security Modules. 
It is a fork of the OpenCA project, building on the experience gained in it.
</p>
<p>
Historically OpenCA was hosted on a web site 
              <a href="<& /lib/url.mas, 
                       host => 'www.openca.org',
                       path => '/' &>">
              http://www.openca.org</a>
Later, a new web site 
              <a href="<& /lib/url.mas, 
                       host => 'www.openca.info',
                       path => '/' &>">
              http://www.openca.info</a>
was established. Today, it is just a link to the site which you are reading. 
We are providing a legacy support for the OpenCA project 
(see <a href="<& /lib/url.mas,
          path => '/legacy/index.html' &>">OpenCA Legacy Support</a> section).

<dt>Architecture White Paper released</dt>
<dd>The OpenXPKI Team has compiled a White Paper on the architecture

as a PDF Document here.</a>

<h2>Proclamation</h2>
<p>OpenXPKI is an OpenSource project based on OpenCA.<br/>
  Due to an ongoing dispute between the developers on licensing and 
  management issues, a group of them decided to split from the 
  project in October 2005. OpenXPKI has become the offical name of the 
  former OpenCA 0.9.3 development.<br/>
  Today these pages include many references to the original OpenCA 
  software and - as we will maintain the current 0.9.2 branch regarding
  security and bug-fixes - this will not change in the near future.
</p><p>
  The new OpenXPKI 1.0 will be built on the efforts of the last two
  years with OpenCA and we hope to release a first beta in summer 2006.
</p><p>
  Development of the new project will happen on the SourceForge.net platform 
  <a href="<& /lib/url.mas, 
	   host => 'sf.net',
	   path => '/projects/openxpki/' &>">
    http://sf.net/projects/openxpki/</a> - you will find 
  mailing lists, repository, bug tracker, etc. there.
