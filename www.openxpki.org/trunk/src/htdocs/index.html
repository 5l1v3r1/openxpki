<h2>About OpenXPKI</h2>
<p>The OpenXPKI Project aims at creating an enterprise-scale 
PKI/Trustcenter software supporting well established infrastructure 
components like RDBMS and Hardware Security Modules. 
It is a fork of the OpenCA project, building on the experience gained in it.
</p>

<h3>Architecture White Paper released</h3>
<p>The OpenXPKI Team has compiled a White Paper on the architecture 
and benefits of the upcoming OpenXPKI software. The paper is <a href="docs/OpenXPKI-Architecture-Overview.pdf">available as a PDF Document here.</a></p>

<h2>Proclamation</h2>
<p>OpenXPKI is an OpenSource project based on OpenCA.<br/>
  Due to an ongoing dispute between the developers on licensing and 
  management issues, a group of them decided to split from the 
  project in October 2005. OpenXPKI has become the offical name of the 
  former OpenCA 0.9.3 development.<br/>
  Today these pages include many references to the original OpenCA 
  software and - as we will maintain the current 0.9.2 branch regarding
  security and bug-fixes - this will not change in the near future.
</p><p>
  The new OpenXPKI 1.0 will be built on the efforts of the last two
  years with OpenCA and we hope to release a first beta in summer 2006.
</p><p>
  Development of the new project will happen on the Berlios platform 
  <a href="<& /lib/url.mas, 
	   host => 'developer.berlios.de',
	   path => '/projects/openxpki/' &>">
    http://developer.berlios.de/projects/openxpki/</a> - you will find 
  mailing lists, repository, bug tracker, etc. there.
