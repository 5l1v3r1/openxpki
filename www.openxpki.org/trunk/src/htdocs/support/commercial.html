<h2>Commercial support</h2>
<p>
  OpenXPKI users are invited to join the project Mailing Lists in order
  to get free support.
  However, our software is admittedly complex and it is not always 
  possible to solve complicated requirements via email.
  Hence if you plan to deploy OpenXPKI in your organization, you may
  be in need of professional support in order to attain
  your project goals.
