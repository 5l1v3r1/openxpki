<h1>Browser interaction with the OpenXPKI server</h1> 

<p>
A single OpenXPKI server running on a UNIX host can serve several CAs, RAs and public interfaces:
depending on the topology of PKI as resulted after deployment procedure. 
The most regular way to access OpenXPKI server is via the web server running on the same UNIX host.
This access is done with a web browser from the local UNIX host or (if allowed) from any host in the internet.
CA operator, RA operator, regular users: everybody can access OpenXPKI server this way.
</p><p>
Different browsers have different understanding and support of cryptography. 
That is why different browsers provide different cryptography related functionality when accessing the OpenXPKI server.
</p>

<h2>All browsers can do</h2>
<p>
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Generation of a private key on the server side </dt>
  <dd>This is a part of procedure to generatate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
Could be performed by a regular user or by RA operator.
Is implemented by built-in tools of the crypto-backend which is installed on the server side.
The user can choose from a list of crypto-algorithms and their parameters available at the server side.
  </dd>
<dt>Upload to the OpenXPKI server of a preliminary prepared CSR</dt>
  <dd>Could be performed by a regular user or by RA operator.
  </dd>

<h2>MS Internet Explorer ver.6+ specific features</h2>

<dl>
<dt>Generation of a private key on the client side </dt>
  <dd>This is a part of procedure to generatate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR). 
Could be performed by a regular user or by RA operator. 
Private key generation is implemented with a Visual Basic Script. 
If several crypto service providers (CSPs) are installed at the client's host, 
a list of CSP's names is shown on the screen along with
a list of parameters for supported crypto-algorithm. 
It is assumed that one CSP provides only one type of crypto-algorithm. 
E.g. only RSA, only DSA, only GOST, or only GOST-on-eliptic-curves.
  </dd>
<dt>Smart card personalisation procedure</dt>
  <dd>Is meant for initial massive issuing of smartcards based on data from LDAP directory of personnel department.
  </dd>
<dt>Signing of approved CSR</dt>
  <dd>Could be performed by RA operator on the client side. Is implemented with a Visual Basic Script. 
  </dd>
<dt>Download and install certifite to the browser</dt>
  <dd>Is implemented with a Visual Basic Script.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h2>Mozilla/Firefox/Netscape specific features</h2>
<p>
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Generation of a private key on the client side </dt>
  <dd>This is a part of procedure to generatate a Certificate Signing Request (CSR).
Could be performed by a regular user or by RA operator.
Private key generation is implemented with a JavaScript. 
Public key is uploaded to the server in SPKAC format.
Personal data of cert holder goes to the server separately.
Server collects data and public key thus effectively forming
an equivalent of unsigned CSR in the server database.
  </dd>
<dt>Signing of approved CSR</dt>
  <dd>Could be performed by RA operator on the client side. Is implemented with a JavaScript.
  </dd>
<dt>Download and install certifite to the browser</dt>
  <dd>Is implemented with a JavaScript.
