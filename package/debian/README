If you want to try out OpenXPKI, you should use our prebuild packages at 
http://packages.openxpki.org. Check out the quickstart how-to at
https://openxpki.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html

These instuctions should work on debian squeeze and 
ubuntu 12.04 lts server.

Install required dependencies
#############################

Install all packages listed in debian-deps.lst
(cat debian-deps.lst  | xargs aptitude install -y)

# CPAN Modules
The current version of the CPAN Workflow module requires Module::Build >0.40
which is outdated in the debian/ubuntu archives. Install a suitable version
from cpan and set PERL5LIB path accordingly.

A simple "make" should now create the required packages in deb/cpan/. 
Before you proceed, install them on your build system!

Build OpenXPKI Modules
#######################
The OpenXPKI build scripts seems to have problems with MakeMaker >6.5
If you have problems building (e.g. empty archives) check the version of
your MakeMaker kit.

The OpenXPKI system consists of three modules, the core, the webfrontend 
and the i18n language files. There are individual make targets for them:

   make core
   make i18n                    
   make mason-html-client
