The tests in this directory are run agains the webserver, so it is not
mandatory to run them on the pki server itself. The tests will work with
an unmodified test system as it is created by the debian packages after
setting up apache to use a server certificate issued by the PKI.

The tests will cover SCEP, SOAP and WebUI doing the following:

* Test the login 
* Use UI to request a pkiclient certificate
* Request an entity certificate with "scep on behalf" (approved via UI)
* Use SOAP to create an anonymous revocation request for the entity
* Use SOAP with SSL authentication / autoapproval (check status via UI)
* Use UI to revoke the pkiclient certificate
* Generate CRL via UI
* Check cert status in database and on CRL

The tests require some prepreqs:

* There must be no valid certificates for the subject used for the 
  pkiclient certificate (testbox.openxpki.org:pkiclient)
* The modules given below must be in your Perl path
* A copy of the sscep binary in your PATH or in this directory
* IP/Name of the server in the config (if not localhost)
* You client system time must match the server time
