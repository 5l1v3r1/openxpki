OpenXPKI is included into the distribution of the basic 
FreeBSD system as a regular port under the FreeBSD name
"security/p5-openxpki":

http://www.freebsd.org/ports/security.html

This port installs all tools of openxpki 
(server-side, client-side, deployment) in one move.
You have to undergo subsequent deployment stage by hand.
This will specify the role, which your computer plays inside the 
PKI infrastructure.

It is very much NOT recommended to copy only one port
security/p5-openxpki onto your computer, if you wish to install it.
This port depends on about 100 other ports. 
Thus it is vitally important to have the entire port collection 
(present on your computer) in a self-consistent state and 
in accord with your base system.

Recommended procedure to make use of the port is:

1. Get/upgrade the entire port collection as described in

http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-using.html 

2. cd /usr/ports/security/p5-openxpki && make install clean

3. perform deployment procedure for openxpki in a regular way.

Just in case: FreeBSD employs one and the same port collection 
in ALL (stable, current, legacy) versions of FreeBSD.

If you find issues with this FreeBSD port, please contact
port maintainer svysh@cryptocom.ru

The latest security/p5-openxpki port aims at version openxpki-0.9.342,
which has a status of intermediate snapshot meant for 
preliminary experiments with openxpki.
