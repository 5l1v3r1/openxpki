== PORT FOR RELEASE ==

OpenXPKI is included into the distribution of the basic 
FreeBSD system as a regular port under the FreeBSD name
"security/p5-openxpki":

http://www.freebsd.org/cgi/ports.cgi?query=openxpki

This port installs all tools of openxpki 
(server-side, client-side, deployment, i18n) in one move.

You have to undergo subsequent deployment stage by hand.
This will specify the role, which your computer plays in the 
PKI infrastructure.

It is very much NOT recommended to copy only one port
security/p5-openxpki onto your computer, if you wish to install it.
This port depends on dozens of other ports. 
Thus it is essential to have the entire port collection 
(present on your computer) in a self-consistent state and 
in accord with your base system.

Recommended procedure to make use of the port is:

1. Get/upgrade the entire port collection as described in

http://www.freebsd.org/doc/en_US.ISO8859-1/books/handbook/ports-using.html 

2. 
cd /usr/ports/sysutils/portupgrade && make reinstall clean
/usr/local/sbin/portupgrade -NrR security/p5-openxpki

(Appropriate tarballs of openxpki will be fetched automatically. 
Alternatively, you can fetch tarballs of openxpki by hand 
and place them into /usr/ports/distfiles/openxpki/)

3. Install your favorite database and web server.

4. Perform deployment procedure for openxpki in a regular way.

Just in case: FreeBSD employs one and the same port collection 
in ALL (stable, current, legacy) versions of FreeBSD.


== PORT FOR SNAPSHOT ==

If you are impatient and want to play with more recent snapshots of 
openxpki, you may try "svn update" and run script 
".../trunk/package/freebsd/build-dist-and-update-port.sh".
This will build tarballs and place them into 
".../trunk/package/freebsd/usr/ports/distfiles/openxpki/".
Then it will attempt to modify Makefile of the port located in the 
".../trunk/package/freebsd/usr/ports/security/openxpki/Makefile".
Checksums for tarballs will be updated too.

Please note, that thus modified port may need manual trimming especially 
in the case when files has been added or removed since last 
revision of openxpki, which was officially submitted to the FreeBSD repository.

If you find issues with this FreeBSD port, please contact
port maintainer svysh@cryptocom.ru
