Base configuration
==================
(install paths)

> ./configure

The configure script prepares the main operative tools for installation.


Installation
============

> make install

This installs the required shell scripts (daemon start script
and config helper) and the XML configuration templates to the 
configured directories.

Configuration
=============

> cd ...etc/openxpki
> openxpki-configure

This step will ask the user for PKI details, such as the number
and names of the PKI realms to configure, CA setup, profile etc.
It writes the configuration changes to
...etc/openxpki/openxpki.conf and creates the XML configuration
files from the settings that were entered.

(It is possible to run the command in batch mode for automated 
configuration.)

From this on the user can decide how to go from there:

1) Inexperienced users or those who are willing to use a
   simplified configuration can continue to use the meta-
   configuration in openxpki.conf, apply changes there and
   generates the XML files from the templates. The XML
   configuration files will be overwritten by this procedure.

   In this case the user will usually:

   > cd .../etc/openxpki
   > ./openxpki-configure
   > openxpkictl restart

2) "Power users" will probably choose not to use the meta-
   configuration and modify the XML files directly:

   > cd .../etc/openxpki
   > rm -f openxpki.conf
   > vi config.xml token.xml ...


Database setup
==============

In order to initialize the database run

> openxpkiadm initdb


Running the server
==================

You can start OpenXPKI by running

> openxpkictl start

To stop the daemon use

> openxpkictl stop
