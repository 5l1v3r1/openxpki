OpenXPKI Manual
===============

The OpenXPKI Manual is written in DocBook, an XML-based language for writing
technical documentation. For more information on DocBook, see
http://www.docbook.org

Compiling the manual
--------------------

    To compile the manual, you need a DocBook environment. The minimal
    requirement to create the HTML version is an XSL processor. and the
    DocBook .xsl files package[0].
    The included Makefile uses the free xsltproc processor from the libxslt
    library [1], but feel free to use the one you like best.

    If you want to create the PDF version as well, you'll also need
    the Apache Formatting Objects Processor (FOP) [2], which converts
    the formatting objects XML into PDF.

    If you would like to compile the manual more than once in a while,
    downloading the DocBook XML schema is recommended as well, as it
    speeds up your compile cycle.

    Note that instead of downloading all of the above manually, there are
    packages or ports available for most Unix-like operating systems.
    In some cases (e.g. Mac OS X), xsltproc is even included in the base
    system.

    Once you have the tools set up, you need to set up a so-called
    "XML Catalog". An XML Catalog is an XML file that maps identifiers
    and URIs to files in your filesystem. This is particularly useful
    if you have a local DocBook XML schema, which you would like to use
    instead of letting the parser download the schema from the web
    every time. An example catalog file named catalog.xml.example is
    included for your convenience. Just edit the corresponding paths,
    set your XML_CATALOG_FILES environment variable to point at the file
    and you're ready to go.

    If you use FOP, you also have to set up the FOP_SH variable definition
    at the top of the Makefile to point to your fop.sh.

    Run make to compile both the HTML and PDF version, which will end up
    in ../openxpki-manual.html|pdf respectively. Using "make check" you
    can run xmllint on the manual to verify it uses DTD-compliant DocBook
    XML. If you just want to compile one of the versions, you can run
    either make html or make pdf to do so.
