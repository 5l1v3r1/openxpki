    <title>Mailing lists</title>
    <para>
      Development discussions and support mostly take place on one of the project's mailing lists. These currently are:
<itemizedlist>
  <listitem>openxpki-devel: Here, development issues are discussed among the developers, but source-related or very technical questions are welcome here as well.</listitem>
  <listitem>openxpki-users: This is the mailing list for the users of OpenXPKI and the place where you should post if you still get stuck after looking up things in the manual</listitem>
  <listitem>openxpki-svn: This is the place where all Subversion checkins are sent to. It is thus only relevant/useful for developers.</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
To post to one of the lists, send a mail to <replaceable>listname</replaceable>@lists.sourceforge.net.
If you want to subscribe to one of the lists, email to <replaceable>listname</replaceable>-request@lists.sourceforge.net with a subject of <quote>subscribe</quote>. <!-- TODO: check if this is correct -->
