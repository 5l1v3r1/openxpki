OpenXPKI sample configuration
#############################

This directory contains configuration snippets to be used with OpenXPKI.
If not stated otherwise, these files reside under /etc/openxpki/config.d/
and are imported by the OpenXPKI configuration system into the internal 
configuration repository using the "openxpkiadm loadcfg" command.

This README give a brief explanation on those snippet.
Please refer to the online documentation for additional info:
http://openxpki.readthedocs.org/en/latest/quickstart.html  


Log configuration (log.conf)
-----------------------------

OpenXPKI uses Log4perl for its logging system. The location of the 
configuration file is set in the systems configuration, where the default 
is /etc/openxpki/log.conf. The file is ready for use, just copy it.   


Basic configuration example (basic)
------------------------------------

The basic directory contains two subdirectories.
* system: A minimal set of the global system configuration. Copy the
  directory to /etc/openxpki/config.d/system/ and adjust the settings 
  as needed. Minimal action: Configure your database.

* realm: The realm directory contains one subdirectory for each pki realm.
  The basic configuration comes with one preconfigured realm named "ca-one",
  which is "ready to go" for a first testdrive. You can create additional
  realms by just making a copy of the directory (cp ca-one ca-two). Don't
  forget to also put the new realm into the system/realm.yaml. 
      
  
Sample Profiles (profiles)
--------------------------

The basic configuration comes with two sample profiles for a web-server 
and a user/email certificate. This directory contains additional profiles.
To use a profile, just copy it to your realm's profile directory.
A brief description of each profile is given inline with each file.
