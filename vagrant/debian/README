Package Mirror
##############

The vagrant files contain (where useful) a shared folder definition for
the package mirror. Create an empty directory packages.openxpki.org next
to the openxpki repository tree. This will be shared as /packages.openxpki.org
and used as source for installing the openxpki packages. Its also used as 
target for creating the upstream mirror in the build-jessie/build-trusty 
machines.   

Vagrant Machines
################
test: 
  The default test machine using debian jessie 
  Grabs the current deb files from the package server/local mirror, 
  installs them using aptitude and runs the sample-setup and some of the 
  qatest.

develop:
  Installs the current packages from the repos and creates a default config
  The /code-repo tree is shared with the host, change code on the host 
  machine and use scripts/deploy.sh inside the guest to copy it over to 
  the actual code base.

build-jessie: 
  build cpan deps, core and i18 from the current tree.
  Installs those packages, runs sample-setup and qatests.
  If you want to create a copy of the public mirror, you need to create
  the /packages.openxpki.org directory inside the vagrant machine, either
  as local directory or as a shared folder as described above.
  Then, after packages are built (which is done be the provisioning script
  usually), call scripts/prepare.sh  from the host and afterwards
  scripts/reprepro.sh from INSIDE the virtual machine. This will use the 
  reprepro tool to create a repo structure. The signing key is defined in
  package/debian/reprepro-debian/distributions and must be available
  on your hosts gpg keyring.  

test-trusty/build-trusty:
  Same as test/build-jessie but for Ubuntu trusty (14.04 LTS)
